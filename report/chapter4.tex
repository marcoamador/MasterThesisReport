\chapter{Requirements Elicitation}\label{chap:chap4}

\section*{}

This chapter will present in detail the first stage on the development process of this thesis, covering the initial usability requirements elicitation.

The following sections provide an analysis of the previously existing work on the project and conclusions drawn from that work, as well as the process that lead to a first redesign, based on those conclusions.

In the last section, the referred redesign, consisting in several alternative solutions, will act as a discussion material in a focus group performed with potential users of the application, in order to elicit usability requirements. All the process of the focus group, as well as all the data gathered from it, is detailed there.
